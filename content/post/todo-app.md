![](/images/todoapp/todoapp.jpg)

The `kjersheim-todo-app` was created as part of a full stack development exercise, focusing on building a simple yet functional frontend application. The goal was to design a minimalistic interface where users can manage a list of todos‚Äîadding, checking off, and removing them as needed.

The project demonstrates the following key elements:

- **Frontend form handling** ‚Äì For capturing new todo inputs.
- **List rendering** ‚Äì Dynamically showing the list of todos on the screen.
- **Interactivity** ‚Äì Users can mark todos as complete/incomplete and remove them.
- **Component logic** ‚Äì Managing state updates when items are added or changed.

## Features

- üìù Add new todo items by typing in a text field and pressing enter or clicking a button.
- ‚úÖ Mark a todo as completed by checking a box.
- ‚ùå Remove a todo item by clicking a delete icon.
- üíæ (Optional) Local storage or simple backend integration for saving tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** ‚Äì The core technologies behind the interface.
- **Lightweight Framework or Vanilla JS** ‚Äì The app likely avoids heavy frameworks to focus on core logic.
- **Git & GitHub** ‚Äì For version control and publishing.

## Future Ideas

While this initial version is primarily focused on frontend functionality, the app could be extended by:

- Adding local storage to persist todos across sessions.
- Creating a backend API for multi-device sync.
- Implementing categories or priorities for tasks.
- Adding deadlines and reminders.

## Purpose

This todo app serves both as a practical coding exercise and a foundation for learning full stack web development. By starting with a tangible and familiar task manager, the project keeps complexity low while allowing for rich future extension possibilities.
