### 4.7 Plans for review and updating

The project plan is a vital and dynamic part of the projects documentation. Dates are recorded in which the date of updating the plan at least must be checked, with current date and version added at the top of the document, while a history of the revised versions are found at the end. Due to project budget limitations, we do not have hosting space to host the older documents - so just the title, author, date and versions are stored. The changes can be found through the GitLab features.

### 4.8 Project Suspension Criteria

The Right Project Plan also includes the project's suspension criteria. However, these are not used in student projects because projects use a certain number of hours to make a result and the result will be released as it is at the end of the course.However, the project team makes a further development plan that a potential new project continues.

## 5. Communication and Tracking of Project Progression
